# I approached the problem by focusing on the core purpose of the project: implementing and utilizing various data structures to solve computational problems efficiently. Here’s a breakdown of my approach:
1. Understanding the Core Objective
    •	The task involves implementing key data structures such as vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees.
    •	The goal is to leverage these structures to perform sorting tasks on a dataset.
    •	The README emphasizes the practical aspects of understanding how these data structures work and how they can be utilized for specific operations like sorting.
2. Highlighting the Importance of Data Structures
Data structures are foundational to computer science for several reasons:
Scalability: Understanding data structures helps developers design systems that handle increasing data volumes without a drop in performance.
    •	Problem Solving: Knowledge of data structures aids in solving real-world problems, like sorting, searching, and data analysis, with the right tools for the job.
3. Connecting the Implementation to Real-World Applications
The description of each data structure focuses on their unique benefits and operations, showing why one might choose a particular structure over another in different scenarios.
4. Presenting Information Clearly
    •	Provided a simple example dataset to demonstrate the practical use of the implemented structures.
This approach not only helps users understand the technical aspects of the project but also underscores why understanding data structures is critical in computer science and software engineering.

This repository contains the implementation of various fundamental data structures for the CS 300 course. The project demonstrates the creation, manipulation, and usage of data structures like vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees. These implementations are designed to efficiently sort and manage a given data set.
## Features
## Vector
    •	Implementation: Dynamic array supporting dynamic resizing.
    •	Operations:
    o	Insertion and deletion.
    o	Sorting using algorithms like Quicksort and Merge Sort.
## Linked List
    •	Implementation: Singly and doubly linked list structures.
    •	Operations:
    o	Node insertion (beginning, middle, end).
## Hash Table
    •	Implementation: Collision-handling via chaining.
    •	Operations:
    o	Key-value pair insertion.
    o	Retrieval and deletion.
    o	Rehashing and resizing.
4. Binary Search Tree (BST)

    •	Implementation: Recursive and iterative methods.
    •	Operations:
    o	Node insertion and deletion.
    o	Inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.
    o	Searching and balancing (optional).
5. Sorting

    •	Sorting of datasets is implemented using these data structures with:
    o	QuickSort.
    o	MergeSort.
    o	HeapSort.
    o	BST-based sorting.

## Working on a project involving the implementation of fundamental data structures significantly expands one's approach to software design and development. Here's how:
## Enhanced Understanding of Core Concepts
    •	Deeper Comprehension of Data Structures: Implementing structures like vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees from scratch provides a thorough understanding of how they work internally. This knowledge enables informed decisions about their application in real-world scenarios.

    •	Adaptability: Tackling various data operations (insertion, deletion, traversal, sorting) strengthens the ability to adapt solutions to different problems.

3. Better Software Design Principles

    •	Encapsulation and Modularity: Designing separate modules for each data structure and its operations reinforces the importance of encapsulation. Each data structure is treated as an independent entity, simplifying debugging and reuse.
    Testing and Validation: Writing test cases for correctness ensures robust implementation and highlights the importance of comprehensive validation in software design.

4. Real-World Application Insight
    •	Scalability Awareness: Implementing hash tables and handling collisions introduces real-world considerations like performance under large datasets and the need for scalable solutions.

## Reflection on Approach to Future Projects

## This experience influences how I approach future projects:

    •	I now prioritize selecting appropriate data structures early in the design phase, ensuring alignment with project goals.
    •	I am more meticulous about performance trade-offs and scalability considerations.
    •	I view testing as an integral part of development rather than an afterthought.

In sum, this project not only reinforces fundamental knowledge but also nurtures a strategic mindset, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical software engineering.
Working on a project that involves implementing core data structures has a profound impact on writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Here's how this experience evolves programming practices:

## Maintainability
## •	Encapsulation and Modular Design:
    Each data structure was implemented as an independent module, with its own set of operations and clearly defined interfaces. This approach makes it easy to debug, test, or extend functionality without impacting other parts of the program.
    o	Example: A HashTable class can have its resizing logic updated without requiring changes to the code that uses it.
## •	Documentation:
    Writing clear documentation for each data structure, its methods, and its purpose makes it easier for future developers (or myself) to understand and modify the code. This practice was reinforced while documenting operations in this project.
## •	Consistence in Naming Conventions:
    Using intuitive and consistent names for variables and functions enhances code maintainability by ensuring clarity.
    Readability
## •	Clean Code Practices:
    o	Used descriptive variable names (e.g., node, key, value) to clarify the role of each element.
    o	Reduced complexity by breaking down large functions into smaller, well-named helper functions.
## •	Structured Formatting:
    Code was structured with proper indentation, spacing, and logical grouping of related methods,
        Adaptability
## •	Scalability Considerations:
    Implementations were designed with scalability in mind. For instance:
    o	Hash tables include collision handling and resizing to accommodate dynamic data sizes.
    o	Binary Search Trees consider balancing techniques to handle degenerate cases.
## •	Abstract Interfaces:
    Abstracting data structure operations (e.g., providing insert(), delete(), search() methods) enables swapping implementations without altering the main program logic.
    o	For example, replacing a simple BST with an AVL tree in the future would require minimal changes to the program.
## •	Reusability:
    Creating reusable code snippets, such as a generic sorting function that works with multiple data structures, ensures that the codebase can adapt to different requirements.
## Error Handling:
    Implementing robust error handling (e.g., detecting key collisions, empty structures, or invalid input) ensures the program can handle edge cases gracefully.
    Example in Practice

## Here are few of these practices play out in a hypothetical situation:
    •	A colleague needs to implement a new sorting algorithm using an existing data structure. Because the data structure's interface is well-documented and modular, they can add the algorithm with minimal knowledge of the underlying implementation.
    •	If a performance bottleneck is discovered in the hash table, swapping it with a more efficient implementation is straightforward due to the modular design.

In summary, this project has fundamentally shaped my approach to writing code that is not just functional but also sustainable over time, easy to read, and flexible to evolving needs.

# What was the problem you were solving with the projects for this course?
    For the customer ABC University, the issue we were attempting to resolve was the storage and presentation of course information, including the course ID, title, and any prerequisites.
    
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. In this course I have learnt several data structures and their advantages and disadvantages for various algorithms over the course. Since data structures form the basis of computer programming, it is crucial to comprehend them. Effective information storage is helpful for projects with thousands of objects that will be hampered by poorly implemented or inefficient data structures.
